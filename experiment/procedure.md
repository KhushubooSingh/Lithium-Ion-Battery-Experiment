Brief Procedure for Lithium-Ion Battery Simulation Experiment (Virtual Lab):

1.Open the virtual lab platform and select the lithium-ion battery simulation module.
2.Set initial parameters such as battery type, state of charge, temperature, and load/resistance.
3.Start the simulation to observe the charging and discharging cycles.
4.Record key outputs: voltage, current, and state of charge over time.
5.Analyze how changing parameters affects battery performance and interpret the results
